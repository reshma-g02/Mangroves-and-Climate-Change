# Mangroves-and-Climate-Change
This paper explores how mangroves act as "blue carbon" sinks to mitigate climate change. It examines their poleward migration into salt marshes due to rising temperatures and their role as natural barriers against storm surges. The study highlights the ecological regime shifts occurring as coastal forests adapt to a warming world.
